1. What is a three-tiered client-server architecture?
2. What is the difference between a vertical distribution and a horizontal distribution?
3. If a client and a server are placed far apart, we may see network latency dominating overall performance. How can we tackle this problem?
4. Consider a chain of processes $P_{1}, P_{2}, \ldots, P_{n}$ implementing a multitiered client-server architecture. Process $P_{i}$ is client of process $P_{i}+1$, and $P_{i}$ will return a reply to $P_{i}-1$ only after receiving a reply from $P_{i}+1$. What are the main problems with this organization when taking a look at the request-reply performance at process $P_{1}$?
5. In a structured overlay network, messages are routed according to the topology of the overlay. What is an important disadvantage of this approach?
6. Consider an unstructured overlay network in which each node randomly chooses $c$ neighbors. If $P$ and $Q$ are both neighbors of $R$, what is the probability that they are also neighbors of each other?
7. Not every node in a peer-to-peer network should become superpeer. What are reasonable requirements that a superpeer should meet?
8. Give an example of a self-managing system in which the analysis component is completely distributed or even hidden.
9. Consider a BitTorrent system in which each node has an outgoing link with a bandwidth capacity $B_{out}$ and an incoming link with bandwidth capacity $B_{in}$. Some of these nodes (called seeds) voluntarily offer files to be downloaded by others. What is the maximum download capacity of a BitTorrent client if we assume that it can contact at most one seed at a time?
10. Modern cars are stuffed with electronic devices. Give some 
  examples of feedback control systems in cars.
